/**
 * The abstract ancestor class of all user job classes. A <b>job</b> is by
 * definition a subclass of this class that implements a method named <code>run
 * </code>.
 * <p>
 * In order to fully take advantage of the framework's compile-time
 * type-checking, a user's job class should subclass one of {@link Job0},
 * {@link Job1}, {@link Job2}, etc instead of directly subclassing this class,
 * and then implement the appropriate type-safe version of {@code run()}. The
 * only reason a user-written job class should directly subclass this class is
 * if the {@code run} method of the job needs to take more arguments than the
 * greatest {@code n} such that the framework offers a {@code Jobn} class.
 * In any case, the provided run method should be reentred as it may be called
 * more than once.
 * <p>
 * This class contains several protected methods that may be invoked from with
 * the {@code run()} method.
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>{@code futureCall()}</b> There is a family of methods named
 * {@code futureCall()} used to specify a job node in a generated child job
 * graph. There are several type-safe versions of {@code futureCall()} such as
 * {@link #futureCall(Job0, JobSetting...)} and
 * {@link #futureCall(Job1, Value, JobSetting...)}. There is also one
 * non-type-safe version
 * {@link #futureCallUnchecked(JobSetting[], Job, Object...)} used for child
 * jobs that directly subclass {@code Job} rather than subclassing {@code Jobn}
 * for some {@code n}.
 * <li> {@link #newPromise(Class)} is used to construct a new
 * {@link PromisedValue}.
 * <li>Several methods that are <em>syntactic sugar</em>. These are methods that
 * allow one to construct objects that may be used as arguments to
 * {@code futureCall()} using less typing. These include
 * <ol>
 * <li> {@link #futureList(List)}. Constructs a new {@link FutureList}
 * <li> {@link #immediate(Object)}. Constructs a new {@link ImmediateValue}
 * <li> {@link #waitFor(Value)}. Constructs a new
 * {@link JobSetting.WaitForSetting}.
 * <li> {@link #backOffFactor(int)}. Constructs a new
 * {@link JobSetting.BackoffFactor}.
 * <li> {@link #backOffSeconds(int)}. Constructs a new
 * {@link JobSetting.BackoffSeconds}.
 * <li> {@link #maxAttempts(int)}. Constructs a new
 * {@link JobSetting.MaxAttempts}.
 * </ol>
 * </ul>
 * As an example of the use of the syntactic sugar, from within a {@code run}
 * method one might write
 *
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * FutureValue&lt;Integer&gt; x = futureCall(new MyJob(), immediate(4));
 * FutureValue&lt;String&gt; s = futureCall(new MySecondJob(), x, immediate("hello");
 * futureCall(new MyThirdJob(), waitFor(s), waitFor(x), maxAttempts(5), backoffSeconds(5));
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * A Job can provide an optional {@code handleException} method that is called
 * when any unhandled exception is thrown from its run method.
 * <p>
 * Before delivering an exception to the job's handleException method the
 * Pipelines framework cancels all descendants jobs that originated from the
 * parent's run method. A descendant job is defined as a job that is either a
 * child or the child of a child (and so on recursively) of the original job.
 * This cancellation is important for a number of reasons.
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * It ensures that no descendant jobs are executed after the handleException
 * method is called.</li>
 * <li>
 * It avoids having dangling jobs which wait for a FutureValue that is never be
 * ready.</li>
 * <li>It helps cleaning up external resources as failureHandlers of descendant
 * jobs are called (with CancellationException) in case of cancellation request
 * from their ancestor. If the descendant job with own failureHandler is a
 * generator job that has its own descendants they are cancelled first before
 * calling the failureHandler.</li>
 * </ul>
 * In case of simultaneous failures only the first one is delivered to the
 * handleException and the other failed job will ignore the cancellation request
 * caused by the first one. A handleException method can act as a generator. So
 * failure handling can be as complex as necessary involving complex job graphs.
 * A failure of a job that is a descendant of the handleException is handled in
 * the same manner as a failure of a job originated in the run method. All
 * failed job siblings originated in the handleException are cancelled and then
 * exception is propagated to the enclosing scope which is either ancestor's run
 * or handleException.
 * <p>
 * {@code handleException} methods must have a single argument of type
 * {@link Throwable} or any of its descendants. If more than one method is
 * specified than the method that has most specific exception parameter that is
 * parent of the thrown exception is called. If called the <code>Value</code>
 * returned by {@code handleException(e)} method is used by the framework
 * instead of the <code>Value</code> returned by <code>run</code>. {@code handleException}
 * method is allowed to throw any exception.
 * <p>
 *
 * @author rudominer@google.com (Mitch Rudominer)
 *
 * @param <E> The return type of the job.
